# JavaDevOps-Containerized-Deploy

## What the Project Is About

**JavaDevOps-Containerized-Deploy** is a comprehensive Java application project that embodies DevOps practices, emphasizing continuous integration and deployment. The project integrates various tools and technologies to streamline the development lifecycle, enhance code quality, and automate deployment processes.

## Tools and Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and prerequisites installed:

- [JDK (Java Development Kit)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - Oracle JDK 8 is recommended.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - Build and project management tool.
- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) - Continuous Inspection tool for static code analysis.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - AWS Command Line Interface for interacting with AWS services.
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) - Automation server used for building, testing, and deploying.

# Project Structure

The project is organized with the following structure:

- **src:** Contains the source code for the Java application.

- **userdata:** This directory contains scripts for setting up Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube. These scripts are designed to streamline the deployment and configuration process. The individual scripts include:

  - `setup-jenkins.sh`: Script for setting up Jenkins.
  - `setup-sonar.sh`: Script for setting up SonarQube.

- **Vagrant:** This directory includes a `Vagrantfile` for provisioning a virtual machine (VM) on the host system. Additionally, scripts are provided to install various tools within the VM. The files in this directory are:

  - `Vagrantfile`: Configuration file for creating and configuring the VM.
  - `install-tools.sh`: Script for installing different tools within the VM.


## Configuration

### Jenkins
